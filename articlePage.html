            <p>Ever noticed how teams often discuss UX (User Experience) research, yet rarely incorporate it into their routine? Of particular interest here are developer tools since their UIs often suggest minimal user research was taken into account. So, what’s preventing these teams from conducting it consistently, and how can we solve the problem?
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Essentially everyone can acknowledge the benefit that solid user experience research (UX research) adds to the final product, but how often is this actually carried out to a satisfactory degree?
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I’d compare UX search to the practice of meditation. The benefits of meditation have been widely recognized, and most people can readily accept these conclusions, however, actually putting this into practice is another story.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This article is primarily addressed to developer tool managers, founders, and teammates. I’ll lay out the struggles that can prevent these teams from developing a solid UX research habit, and I’ll recommend ways to overcome those.
            </p><br>
    
            <h4>
                Let’s be careful when defining UX research
            </h4><br>
    
            <img src="OIP.jpeg" class="UIUX" alt="Explaining the difference betweem user interface and user experience, UI is more about the style and colors, where the UX is about the main functionality" title="UI UX">
            

            <p>
                Before we jump in to the actionable steps, let’s lay out a bit of context so we can understand the situation as we face it.
            </p><br>
    
            <p>
                First, it’s crucial for us to differentiate between UX research and customer research. These terms are often used interchangeably, but this can lead to misunderstandings.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Let’s demystify that difference right now:
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <h5>Customer research is all about understanding</h5> 
                why and what your customers want and need. This research is carried out using surveys, group discussions, and one-on-one talks. It helps us improve our products and keep our customers happy, and it also supports our decisions in terms of how to market our product and support our customers. 
                      </p><br>
            <p><h5>UX research involves learning how people actually</h5>
                use a product in practice and how they feel about it. By doing this research, we can find problems and make our products better. For instance, we can reduce the time it takes for users to complete their tasks, and reduce mistakes that can occur due to the UI design. We want to end up with products that people want to keep using. This can be because they feel effortless to use, or as a result of convenient user flows.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                While customer research can inform your product development strategy, UX research is essential for creating a better version of your product in practice. In particular, for teams who are primarily focused on the tech side of things, the confusion between customer research and UX research is essential to clear up. Allowing this misunderstanding to fester can make UX research seem overly complex and not worth the time investment it deserves. Let’s talk about this point a bit more.

                </p>

                <h4>Obstacle #1: justifying UX research to the tech-focused crowd</h4><br>
        <p>Many dev tool founders were initially software engineers themselves. In my view, people who work with code usually like to work independently, and they might even be hesitant to accept outside opinions; instead, they’ll trust their own judgment first and foremost. This is actually probably just a characteristic of human beings in general, but in terms of making the case for UX research, this can nevertheless present a hurdle to overcome.</p><br>
        <p>“Self-biased” developers could therefore find themselves stuck in a “make-check-adjust” routine, implementing quick product changes instead of collecting and leveraging user feedback to guide their choices.</p><br>
        <p>Beyond that, in general, a programmer’s passion for technology over the users themselves could be an obstacle to UX research progress. The excitement of using a cool API or the latest tech solution could be more attractive than the prospect of understanding user behavior and needs.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Obstacle #2: finding UX research participants</h4><br>
        <p>Even if a particular developer tool has a diverse user base, the fact remains that dev tools also usually have a niche target audience. Seemingly, this limitation could make it challenging to find the right range of participants for UX search purposes.</p><br>
        <p>To guide you as you overcome this challenge, I have 2 do’s and one don’t.<br>
            <br>First up, the do’s:<br>
            <br> DO: Treat your target candidates like gold. Researchers must focus on building relationships with potential participants, as this is key to gaining valuable insights and feedback that can help your product.<br>
            <br>DO: Use recruiting platforms that allow you to screen your audience using advanced beyond just basic demographics. Some of these platforms can also help you handle the research design (like surveys, usability tests, and so on) and participant rewards.<br>
            <br>  DON’T: While you could certainly reach out to your target audience by directly using social media like LinkedIn or Facebook, it’s quite likely that folks won’t appreciate seeing your messages in their inbox. So, I really just don’t recommend using a formal or cold outreach approach for your dev tools UX research goals.<br>
        </p><br>
       <h4>Obstacle #3: knowing what to research</h4><br>
       <p>Common products like ecommerce or personal apps usually involve a few workflows, but dev tools are often a kind of multi-tool that users might use in a number of different ways. They often have complex workflows and features that may be difficult to understand or test at first glance.</p><br><p>This difficulty can make designing effective research studies and gathering meaningful insights challenging. For instance, conducting a study aimed at understanding every aspect of user satisfaction within a well-established feature, such as the global navigation UI, can lead to non-actionable items or common conclusions that everyone already knows. On the other hand, conducting user research to improve, let’s say, button colors for dev environment tags in the UI, might appear excessive.</p><br>
       <p>Instead, it’s crucial to ensure that the research study subject is well-balanced, focusing on topics that provide valuable insights while being cost-effective, rather than investing in a thorough research process with a substantial budget allocated for participant engagement on less impactful matters.</p><br>
       
       <h4>Obstacle #4: we don’t have time for UX research</h4><br>
       <p>Developers must often work within tight deadlines and short iteration timeframes.<br>

        Frankly speaking, teams may not have the time to design and conduct lengthy UX research sessions. Indeed, this can make it difficult to gather sufficient data and insights. But the situation is not hopeless by any means.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Obstacle #5: we don’t have UX research experience</h4><br>
        <p>I posit that dev tool developers constantly engage in UX research, it just manifests a little differently than expected.<br>

            Think about it: within developer communities, particularly with platforms like GitHub, interaction and feedback are everywhere. If you’ve participated in any discussion like that, you’ve participated in some part of the UX research process.</p><br>

        <h4>The final obstacle</h4><br>
        <p>To bring things back full circle, just like meditation, you can know all the benefits of something, but still fail to put it into active use.
